# Community

Welcome to the Community repo. This repo is community-maintained, designed by the community for the community. 

It's a place for you to open issues and PRs for other community members to provide feedback, review and contribute, a peer-driven approach. There is no fixed approach, it is up to the community to set the guidelines that work. If you have ideas on how to draft the community guidelines to make the experience easy, jump in and suggest them. 

If you make an issue or PR, think of your fellow reviewers, provide context, screenshots, and logical commits to make collaboration smoother. If you are a reviewer, following a similar approach of thoughtful, respectful, detailed and constructive reviews will be appreciated. Ask questions, these will always help advance the review. 

TODO: 
How can we build a consensus-based merging culture or community? Looking for input
What guidelines would you want to see to help streamline the experience? Looking for input
Build Gno in [packages/](./packages).
Repo steps/improvements (please, work on some!):
- [ ] Connect the contracts/ folder to the `gnoverse` namespace on Staging
  - [ ] Figure out how to manage deployer address (maybe via `gnomod.toml`?)
- [ ] Setup basic CI to test p/ & r/ in packages/
- [ ] Migrate some/most of the personal packages from [examples/](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/tree/master/examples) here.
Start migrating the process of new examples/ from the monorepo to here.
