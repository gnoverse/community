## GnoPUB ðŸ“º:

# Intro :

I aimed to recreate an advertising space similar to the Sandbox project, but encountered several challenges when trying to paste and integrate images onto the clickable surface. For now, the concept focuses on building an advertising grid where individual slots can be bought and sold. Once a plot is purchased, it becomes a link to the buyerâ€™s advertisement, which can be configured using the `Setpub` function.
Each ad is tied to a specific cell, allowing users to own multiple spaces for different promotional content.

# Tutorial :

### Step 1 :
Buy a cell with the function `BuyCells`
### Step 2 :
Set the pub and the label with the function `UpdateCells` on yours cells
### Step 3 :
Sell your cells with the function `SellCells`

# RoadMap :

 -Add determined price (totalcells / availablecells) * baseprice
 -Add number of clicks
