## GnoPUB :

# Intro :

I aimed to recreate an advertising space similar to the Sandbox project, but encountered several challenges when trying to paste and integrate images onto the clickable surface. For now, the concept focuses on building an advertising grid where individual slots can be bought and sold. Once a plot is purchased, it becomes a link to the buyerâ€™s advertisement, which can be configured using the `Setpub` function.
Each ad is tied to a specific cell, allowing users to own multiple spaces for different promotional content.

# Planned :

 -Add pseudo on button
 -Add sellcells function with determined price (totalcells/availablecells)*baseprice
 -Add stats on pub like amount of clicks ect
